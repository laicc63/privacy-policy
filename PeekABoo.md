## Overview

PeekABoo ("the App") is a photo and video viewer for iOS designed for children.
Your privacy — and your child's privacy — is our top priority.

**In short: We don't collect any data. Period.**

---

## Information We Collect

**None.**

PeekABoo does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information,
usage data, or analytics data. The App operates entirely on your device.

---

## Photo Library Access

PeekABoo requires access to your device's photo library in order to display
photos and videos. This access is:

- **Read-only** — the App cannot modify, delete, or add photos to your library
- **On-device only** — your photos and videos are never uploaded, transmitted,
  or shared with anyone
- **User-controlled** — you can revoke photo library access at any time in iOS
  Settings

---

## Face Detection

PeekABoo uses Apple's built-in Vision framework to detect human faces in your
photos. This processing:

- Happens **entirely on your device**
- Does **not** use any cloud services, APIs, or external servers
- Does **not** identify, recognize, or name any individuals
- Only determines whether a photo contains a human face (yes/no)
- Results are cached locally on your device and never transmitted

---

## In-App Purchases

PeekABoo offers a one-time in-app purchase processed entirely through Apple's
App Store. We do not receive, process, or store any payment information. All
transactions are handled by Apple. See
[Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) for details.

---

## Children's Privacy

PeekABoo is designed for use by children. We comply with the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar international regulations:

- We do **not** collect any personal information from children (or anyone)
- We do **not** use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs
- We do **not** contain any links that navigate outside of the App
- We do **not** display any advertisements
- The App contains no social features, no user accounts, and no communication
  capabilities

---

## Third-Party Services

PeekABoo does **not** integrate any third-party services, SDKs, or frameworks
that collect data. The only external interaction is Apple's StoreKit for
processing in-app purchases, which is handled by Apple.

---

## Data Storage

All data stored by PeekABoo remains on your device:

| Data                 | Purpose                            | Storage                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Face detection cache | Avoids re-scanning photos          | On-device (Core Data)           |
| App settings         | Orientation, filters, sort order   | On-device (UserDefaults)        |
| Purchase state       | Tracks whether the app is unlocked | On-device (Keychain)            |
| Parent PIN           | Protects settings from children    | On-device (Keychain, encrypted) |

None of this data is transmitted off your device. If you delete the App, all
locally stored data (except Keychain items) is removed.

---

## Analytics

PeekABoo uses **Apple's built-in App Analytics** only, which is managed by Apple
as part of the App Store. This data is:

- Anonymized and aggregated by Apple
- Not accessible to us in any personally identifiable form
- Controlled by the user (you can opt out of sharing analytics in iOS Settings >
  Privacy > Analytics)
- Not collected by any SDK within the App itself

We do **not** use Firebase, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, or any other
third-party analytics tool.
